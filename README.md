# Android-Developer-Guide
Hi, my name is Serj Ardovic and I'm an Android developer. Every now and then, I stumble upon interesting links of videos, tutorials, articles and other stuff which I find very useful. I used to keep them links in bookmarks tab, yet it got messy and hard to follow in no time. So, I decided to keep them here... 

P.S.: Since this list contains only links to stuff I've already tested, I can <b>GUARANTEE</b> it's usefulness. If for some unknown reason you would want to see something on this list, feel free to make a pull request with your changes. Eventually I'll get to it, and possibly add to the lsit.
