# Android-Developer-Guide
Hi, my name is Serj Ardovic and I'm an Android developer. Every now and then, I stumble upon interesting links of videos, tutorials, articles and other stuff which I find very useful. I used to keep them links in bookmarks tab, yet it got messy and hard to follow in no time. So, I decided to keep them here..

P.S.: Since this list contains only links which I've tested, I can <b>GUARANTEE</b> it's usefulness. If for some unknown reason you want to make changes to it, feel free to make a pull request with your changes..

I've marked easy stuff with green - ![](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+), medium level with blue - ![](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+), and relatively tricky topics with red - ![](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) squares..
